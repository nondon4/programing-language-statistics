# Usage

Due to GitHub file size limits, the data sets are zipped, and must be extracted before use. Extract 
data/commits-subset.zip, and data/repo-languages.zip to data/.

data/big-query-scripts contains the sql scripts used in Google BigQuery to generate the data sets.

Analysis.py is the main program.  It is a transcript from an interactive IPython session.

LanguageData.py contains the logic for loading and doing most of the initial data processing.

language-pairs.json, language-timeline.json, language-totals.json, and months.json are data files generated by 
Analysis.py for visualization.html.
